# componentDidGenerate

This talk was first given on June 25th, 2018 at the ReactNYC Meetup.

#### Blurb:

Almost everyone has used create react app before and for good reason. With a single stroke at the command line, you can spin up a new react application ready to go. But what about other tools such as SCSS, Redux, or even a full-stack app with a back end? Introducing [Create New App](https://github.com/qodesmith/create-new-app)! In this talk we'll see how Create New App works, look at the code it generates, and highlight [some](https://www.npmjs.com/package/command-line-args) [key](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validate-npm-package-name) [node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk) [packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) that were used to bring this to life!

#### About this repo:

This repo is a slideshow app built with React to facilitate my presentation. Maybe it's because I suck at PowerPoint - or LibreOffice Impress - or perhaps it's just that React rules. Either way, I found it more fun & interesting to build my own slideshow app to give my presentation than using something else out of the box.

Once you've downloaded & `npm install`ed this project, run it with `npm start`. To navigate the slides use the ← and → arrow keys. To advance the presentation on any given page, hit the spacebar. That's it!

This project was created with [Create New App](https://github.com/qodesmith/create-new-app).
